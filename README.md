## Smart Contract Integration

Smart contracts will be written in Move for Movement M1. The hooks in `src/hooks/` are structured to easily integrate with Movement contract calls once they're deployed.

### Contract Hooks (To be implemented)

- `useWallet()` - Wallet connection and management
- `useSampledContract()` - Contract interaction hooks:
  - Upload samples
  - Purchase samples
  - Withdraw earnings
  - Query samples and stats
